# Emir's Personal Website

This is the source code for my website (eturkes.com), which runs on Django CMS. Feel free to use any of the code in your project, just check ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS and LICENSE for copyright info. Scripts for building, rebuilding, backing up, and cleaning the web server are located in the `helper-scripts` directory. They make some assumptions about system configuration, so tailor to your needs. Tested on openSUSE 15.
